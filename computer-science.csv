Union-Find,"Form graph components based on connectivity of nodes.

When merging components, the component of smaller cardinality is attached to the component of higher cardinality.

Components are typically represented as trees, not sets.

Importantly, the find (root) operation doesn't only follow links to parents but also mutates the tree ('compression'). There are two common options:
1. Attach every node on the path to the root to the root
2. Attach every node on the path to the root to the node's grandparent

Priority Queue,"Is an abstract data structure that is typically instantiated via a binary min or max heap."
B-Tree,"TODO"
Heap datastructure,"Is a tree (can be binary, mustn't be) in which every parent is larger (max) or smaller (min) that its children.

Binary heaps are always perfectly balanced by adhering to these two rules:
1. When adding a node, it is added as the right-most leaf. Then it is propagated up as far as necessary on the path to the root.
2. When extracted a root, it is first replaced by the right-most leaf. This leaf is than propagated down as far as necessary on a path to a leaf.

Since they are perfectly balanced, they can be very easily represented by an array. Therefore, in a min heap, it holds that:
a[i] <= a[2*i + 1] and a[i] = a[2*i + 2]
conversely, in holds that
a[i] >= a[(i-1) // 2]
"
Trie,"A.k.a prefix tree: a tree which represents collection of strings.

Every character of every string is represented by a node. Some nodes can be 'terminal'
in that they are not only a prefix of a tree but also contain a complete string."
